# Crazy Translator 👾
This translator uses Google's Translation API to translate your text<br>
But it's kinda different from the generic translators 🙄

With this one you can translate your text several times into several languages AT THE SAME TIME 🤩<br>
It's useful if you want a sentence written in a different way

By the way, you may get some really funny/weird results
